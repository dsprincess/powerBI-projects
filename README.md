**Space Challenge**
My first dashboard project last August 2022 when I joined the Maven Space Challenge.
We were given a dataset containing all the space explorations starting from 1957 up to 2020.
I remember I was just starting out in data visualization during that time and decided to try my newly acquired skills.

**Spotify Analysis**
In this dashboard, I reviewed the streaming trends for the online music streaming platform Spotify. I also made a list for the top songs based on the number of streams and based on the average position in the charts. From these, I was able to get insights as to what songs Filipinos loved during 2017 to 2022. Lastly, artists were ranked per popularity score and number of followers. A few Filipino artist made it on the top.

**Revenue Analysis**
In this dashboard, the product details and sales transactions were provided.

**PA 2022 Annual Sales Report**

*Space Challenge
My first dashboard project last August 2022 when I joined the Maven Space Challenge.
We were given a dataset containing all the space explorations starting from 1957 up to 2020.
I remember I was just starting out in data visualization during that time and decided to try my newly acquired skills.

*Spotify Analysis
In this dashboard, I reviewed the streaming trends for the music platform Spotify. I also made a list for the top songs based on the number of streams and based on the average position in the charts. From this, I was able to get insights as to what songs Filipinos loved during 2017 to 2022. Lastly, artists were ranked per popularity score and number of followers. A few Filipino artist made it on top.
